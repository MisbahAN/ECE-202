# ECE 202 - Electrical Circuits I Lab Repository

## Overview
This repository contains all the lab manuals and result sheets for my ECE 202 - Electrical Circuits I course at the University of Alberta. This course focuses on fundamental circuit analysis concepts, providing hands-on experience with topics like circuit laws, theorems, phasors, and AC power analysis.

### Course Information
- **Course Code:** ECE 202
- **Credits:** 3 units (fi 8)(FIRST, 3-1S-3/2)
- **Faculty:** Faculty of Engineering, University of Alberta
- **Prerequisites:** MATH 101, 102

### Topics Covered
- Circuit laws: Ohm’s Law, Kirchhoff’s Voltage and Current Laws (KVL, KCL)
- Basic loop and nodal analysis, voltage and current dividers
- Circuit theorems: superposition, Thevenin, Norton, and maximum power transfer
- Time domain behavior of inductors and capacitors
- Sinusoidal signals, phasor and impedance concepts
- Single phase power and power factor analysis

## Lab Structure
Each folder in this repository contains:
- **Lab Manual:** Instructions and theory for each lab experiment
- **Result Sheet:** Completed data and results obtained from each lab
